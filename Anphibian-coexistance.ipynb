    "A zoo biologist will place three species of amphibians (a toad, a salamander, and a caecilian) in an aquarium where they will feed on three different small preys: worms, crickets, and flies. Each day 1,500 worms, 3,000 crickets, and 5,500 flies will be placed in the aquarium. Each amphibian consumes a certain number of preys per day. Table 1-2 summarizes the relevant data.\n",
